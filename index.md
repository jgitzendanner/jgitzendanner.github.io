Hello! I am a 4th year [Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.ucf.edu/) undergraduate student in the [Burnett Honors College](https://honors.ucf.edu/) at the University of Central Florida!

Patterns in nature have a staggering regularity and prevelance, especially when considering the notorious complexity of their constituent materials (often some type of fluid). I have always enjoyed finding these, and as my technical background has grown, my passion has shifted to modeling these patterns. Many offer an oportunity to parametrize a process occuring at a much larger scale, a point that has led to my fascination with geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics.

My background focuses on multiphase fluid dynamics with experience in hydrodynamic modeling and reactive compressible granular flows. I started in undergraduate research nearly four years ago towards the end of my first semester, and since then, have been working in numerical simulation. My first couple of years focused on building an understanding for the software and techniques by working on as many projects as possible and building a passion for the field. In January of 2022 I joined the Computational Biomechanics Lab on a "passion project" to model polo kayaks.

My current research studies methods for drag reduction in kayaks with the goal of designing a better polo kayak. We are observing how a kayak's asymmetry affects its drag as the boat transitions to planing.
