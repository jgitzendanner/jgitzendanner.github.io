I am a 4th year [Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.ucf.edu/) undergraduate student in the [Burnett Honors College](https://honors.ucf.edu/) at the University of Central Florida

My background focuses on multiphase fluid dynamics with experience in hydrodynamic modeling and reactive compressible granular flows.

 My current research studies methods for drag reduction in kayaks with the goal of designing a better polo kayak.
